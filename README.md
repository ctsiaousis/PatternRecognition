# Pattern Recognition
Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition using Matlab

The assignments from the `TEL311 â€“ Statistical Modeling and Pattern Recognition` course of [ECE](https://www.ece.tuc.gr/) department of [TUC](https://www.tuc.gr/)  

___  
### Fields  

* [Principal Component Analysis](./PrincipalComponentAnalysis/) The famous algorithm implemented on Matlab from scratch. An example with a simple 2D dataset and another with a dataset consisting of 5000 faces.
* [Linear Discriminant Analysis](./LinearDiscriminantAnalysis/) LDA written from scratch. Also a comparison with the PCA implementation. 
* [Bayes Classification](./BayesClassification/) A simple Bayes classifier to distinct between handwritten digits (1 and 2) based on their bounding rect aspect ratio.
* [Logistic Regression](./LogisticRegression/) A simple Logistic Regression with Gradient and Sigmoid function. It is trained on a virtual dataset of `grade1, grade2, [0|1]` and can predict if a student (given his scores) passes or fails the course.
* [Regularized Logistic Regression](./RegularizedLogisticRegression/) We now have a dataset that expresses Quality Control outcomes of a chip manufacturing company.
* [Naive Bayes Classifier](./NaiveBayesClassifier/) A full probabilistic classifier that recognizes all handwritten digits, while also calculating accuracy and confusion matricies.
* [Support Vector Machines](./SupportVectorMachines/) An SVM demonstration on both linear and non-linear datasets.
* [Feature Selection](./FeatureSelection/) A demonstration of the Leave-One-Out cross-validation method and an overfitting example.
* [Neural Network from scratch](./NeuralNetwork-from-scratch/) Simple sigmoid-activated NN using numpy.
* [Convolutional Neural Network](./ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork/) CNN architecture and optimizer comparison on a fashion classification problem using TensorFlow, Keras API and MNIST dataset.
