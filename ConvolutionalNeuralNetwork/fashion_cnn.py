# Training the neural network model requires the following steps:

#   1. Feed the training data to the model. In this example, the training data is in the train_images and train_labels arrays.
#   2. The model learns to associate images and labels.
#   3. You ask the model to make predictions about a test setâ€”in this example, the test_images array.
#   4. Verify that the predictions match the labels from the test_labels array.
